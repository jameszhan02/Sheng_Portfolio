                  Implemented alert mechanisms for backend APIs and advocated
                  for an on-call system within the team. This approach uses
                  multiple metrics as standards, including average API response
                  time, error rates, third-party service status, server
                  performance, and overall service health. These improvements
                  significantly reduced app downtime and enhanced user
                  experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Redesigned the Java API architecture by advocating for and
                  implementing Redis caching and asynchronous job processing.
                  This strategic enhancement significantly reduced API response
                  times and decreased server costs by $5,000 annually.

                  Automated accounting workflows by replacing manual data entry
                  with E2E testing tools, saving the department 15+ hours per
